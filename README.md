Registration Form & Character Counter Web App
This project is a simple web application that combines a registration form with real-time validation and a character counter for a text area. Both features are built using HTML, JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

Features:
Registration Form: Validates user input in real time. It checks if the name is filled, if the email is valid, and if the password is long enough (minimum 6 characters). The submit button is disabled until all fields are correctly filled.

Character Counter: Allows users to type a message into a text area with a 200-character limit. It shows how many characters have been typed and how many are remaining. If the limit is exceeded, further typing is prevented, and a warning message is shown.

Navigation: You can easily switch between the registration form and the character counter with buttons or direct links to each section.
